Running Instructions
FROMP is Java program and hence requires an installed and working Java version. You can get the latest java version from \url{http://java.com/en/}.

For Windows
Unzip the .zip file to extract the Fromp-v1.0 folder and double click on the "FROMP.jar" file. 

For Linux
The default java environment in Linux is the OpenJDK. However, if you are not sure which java environment came with your version of linux, you should get the latest Sun Java JDK and the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and then congfigure your Linux so that it uses the Sun java instead of the default. You can find tips on how to do that for Fedora, RHEL and CentOS at \url{http://www.freetechie.com/blog/installing-sun-java-on-fedora-12/} and for Ubuntu at \url{https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java}


Unzip the .zip file to extract the Fromp-v1.0 folder. Change directory to this folder and type: 

For GUI version:

java -jar FROMP.jar 

For command line:

java -jar FROMP.jar <insert arguments here>
